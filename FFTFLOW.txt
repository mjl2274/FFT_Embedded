For FFT Code:
1) Need to process whole audio:
2) Maybe spit out notes every 5 seconds?
3) Need to FFT whole audio in chunks, process each chunk and form the frequency spectrum as we go 
4) Need to match notes in time sequentially:

Flow

Process --> Filter --> until sample time = 2-5 seconds, pick out top 3 notes
--> Process --> Filter --> repeat
